This is a basic Express application that serves static assets 
from the public folder and sends a 404 response for any other routes. 
The commented out code suggests that the index.html file for a navbar-app should be served from the root route, but this has been replaced by the static asset serving middleware.

The express.static() middleware serves static assets like HTML, CSS, 
JavaScript, images, etc. from a specified directory. In this case, it's 
serving assets from the public folder, which should be located in the 
root directory of the application.

The app.all() method registers a route handler that will be executed for 
all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and for any route that hasn't 
been matched by another handler. In this case, it sends a 404 response with the 
message "resource not found".

Overall, this application is useful for serving static assets for a front-end 
application or for setting up a basic API with a catch-all error handler.
