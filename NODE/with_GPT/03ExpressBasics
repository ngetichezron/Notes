app.get is an HTTP method in Express.js used to define a route that 
listens for GET requests on a specified path. When a GET request is 
made to the specified path, the corresponding callback function is 
executed, which can be used to handle the request and send back a 
response to the client.

Similarly, app.post, app.put, and app.delete are HTTP methods in Express.js 
used to define routes that listen for POST, PUT, and DELETE requests, respectively.

app.all is a special HTTP method in Express.js that is used to define 
a route that matches any HTTP method. This means that it can be used to 
handle any type of request made to a specific path.

app.use is a middleware function in Express.js that is used to mount 
middleware functions at a specified path. Middleware functions are functions 
that can access and modify the request and response objects and execute some 
additional code before the final route handler is called.

app.listen is a method in Express.js that is used to start a server and 
listen for incoming requests on a specified port. When a request is received 
on the specified port, Express.js invokes the corresponding route handler function.
