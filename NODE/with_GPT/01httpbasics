This code sets up a basic HTTP server using Node.js and responds to requests for the home page 
and the about page with some HTML content. If a request is made for any other URL, the server 
will respond with a "page not found" message.

To use this server, you can run it in a terminal with the command 
node <filename.js> (replacing <filename.js> with the actual name of the file). 
Then you can open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 to see 
the home page, or http://localhost:5000/about to see the about page.

Note that this is a very basic server and is not suitable for production use. 
For example, it does not handle errors well, does not have any security features, 
and does not support HTTPS. For more advanced use cases, it is recommended to use a 
dedicated web framework like Express.
