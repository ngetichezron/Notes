This is a basic Node.js server that creates an HTTP server using the http module and listens on port 5000. It serves different resources based on the URL requested by the client.

The resources served include:

    The home page (index.html) and its associated CSS (styles.css) and JavaScript (browser-app.js) files, which are read from the file system using the readFileSync method from the fs module.
    The logo image (logo.svg), which is also read from the file system.
    An about page, which is just a simple HTML string.
    A 404 page, which is also a simple HTML string.

When a client makes a request, the server checks the URL and serves the appropriate resource with the appropriate content type. If the URL doesn't match any of the expected resources, it serves a 404 page.

This approach can work for small projects or for prototyping, but it doesn't scale well and can quickly become unwieldy for larger applications. Express.js provides a simpler and more robust way to build web applications in Node.js, as shown in the previous examples.
