This code sets up a basic Express server that serves static files 
from the ./public directory and sends an HTML file for the 
root route / using res.sendFile(). All other routes that are not 
defined will return a 404 error with the message "resource not found".

The path module is used to resolve the absolute path to the index.html file. 
The express.static() middleware is used to serve static files, such as CSS and 
JavaScript files, from the ./public directory.

The server listens on port 5000 and logs a message to the console when it starts running.

Overall, this code provides a basic setup for serving static files and 
sending HTML files in an Express app.
