This code exports an Express router instance that handles HTTP requests to the '/people' endpoint using the functions defined in the ../controllers/people.js module.

The const declaration is used to extract the getPeople, createPerson, createPersonPostman, updatePerson, and deletePerson functions from the ../controllers/people.js module.

The router instance defines routes using the router.route() method, which can be used to create chainable route handlers for a single route path. The router.route('/') method creates a route for the root path '/people' that responds to GET requests with the getPeople function and POST requests with the createPerson function. The router.route('/postman') method creates a route for the '/people/postman' path that responds to POST requests with the createPersonPostman function. The router.route('/:id') method creates a route that handles PUT requests with the updatePerson function and DELETE requests with the deletePerson function, where :id is a dynamic route parameter that corresponds to the id property of a person object.

By using the router.route() method, we can define multiple HTTP verbs for a single URL path in a single code block, which can help to make the code more readable and easier to maintain.

Finally, the router instance is exported so that it can be used by other modules in the application. This allows you to modularize your code and organize your routes in a more maintainable way.
