This code creates an Express application instance, which is assigned to the app variable.

The express module is required and the people and auth modules are imported from the ./routes directory. These modules contain the route handlers for the people and authentication endpoints respectively.

The app.use() method is used to add middleware functions to the application's request processing pipeline. The first middleware function uses the express.static() middleware to serve static assets from the ./methods-public directory. The second middleware function uses the express.urlencoded() middleware to parse incoming form data. The third middleware function uses the express.json() middleware to parse incoming JSON data.

The app.use() method is also used to define the base URL for the people and authentication endpoints. When a request is made to the base URL followed by '/api/people', the people router is used to handle the request. Similarly, when a request is made to the base URL followed by '/login', the auth router is used to handle the request.

The app.listen() method is used to start the Express application and make it listen for incoming requests on port 5000. When the application starts listening, a message is logged to the console.

Overall, this code sets up an Express application that can handle requests to the '/api/people' and '/login' endpoints and serve static assets, parse incoming form and JSON data, and listen for incoming requests on port 5000.
