This code sets up an Express server that listens on port 5000 
and returns all the products in the ./data file as a JSON response 
when the root URL / is requested.

javascript

const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const { products } = require('./data')
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.json(products)
})

app.listen(5000, () => {
  console.log('Server is listening on port 5000....')
})

The express module is imported and an instance of the app is created with express(). 
The products object is imported from the data.js file. The app.get() method sets up a 
route for the root URL / and a callback function that sends the products object as a 
JSON response using the res.json() method.

Finally, the server is started and listens on port 5000 using the 
app.listen() method.
