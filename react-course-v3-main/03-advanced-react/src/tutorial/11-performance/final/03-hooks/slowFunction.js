/*

In this code, there are three React components and a slowFunction module.

LowerState component renders a button and a List component. It also defines two state variables using the useState hook: people which is an array of objects and count which is an integer. The people state variable is initialized with the data array imported from an external module. The removePerson function is defined using the useCallback hook, which filters out the person with the specified id from the people array and updates the people state. The value constant is defined using the useMemo hook, which caches the result of the slowFunction module. The console.log function is used to log the value of value. When the button is clicked, the count state variable is updated. The List component is rendered with the people and removePerson props.

List component is a simple component that maps over the people array and renders an Item component for each object in the array. It receives people and removePerson props from the parent component. This component is wrapped with the memo function, which memoizes the component, so it only re-renders when its props change.

Person component receives name, id, and removePerson props from the parent List component. It renders the name and a button that calls the removePerson function when clicked, passing in the id prop.

slowFunction module exports a function that performs a long computation and returns the result. This function is called from the LowerState component using the useMemo hook to cache the result.
